**And Yet Another Dotfile Repo:**

I just had to have my own because I want it to be really simple;
something that works out of the box for my-dumb-self.

I've worked quite hard on some of these, like the vimrc, but
someone should be able to automate a lot of work that is currently
done manually to set vim up with this .vimrc. You're welcome to
fork and do that.
